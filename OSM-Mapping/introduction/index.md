# Introduction

On this module, we will try to integrate Open Street Map (OSM) school data to the ProjectConnect database. There are different alternates to map OSM data to ProjectConnect:

- Pull OSM data in .csv format and add it to ProjectConnect database using the Content Management System (CMS)
- Automat the mapping process by dynamically pulling the data from OSM and mapping it to ProjectConnect database.
