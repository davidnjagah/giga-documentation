## Giga Open Source Projects  

Welcome to Giga's open-source repository showcase!  

As part of **Giga** we are dedicated to leveraging open-source technologies to connect schools to the internet by 2030. Below, you'll find a list of our public repositories, each contributing to our mission through innovative tools and technologies.  

## Repositories  

### [üó∫Ô∏èGiga Maps](https://github.com/unicef/giga-maps-frontend)  
**Description:**  
Giga Maps aims to build a global, dynamic map that showcases the status of school connectivity in the world. This tool helps to identify gaps in school connectivity, create transparency, estimate the capital investment needed to connect unconnected schools, develop plans, attract the necessary funding, and track progress towards achieving universal school Internet connectivity.

### [üìäGiga Meter](https://github.com/unicef/project-connect-daily-check-app)  
**Description:**  
GigaMeter is a client desktop application that can be installed on Windows that automatically measures the internet upload and download speed of a network using minimal data. The App is automatically scheduled to run four internet speed tests daily.

It can be installed on a user device (such as a computer or laptop) and configured easily to send daily internet connectivity information to a database. It utilizes the Network Diagnostic Tool (NDT) protocol which is developed, maintained and hosted by Measurement Lab (M-Lab).

Giga uses GigaMeter to measure school connectivity, sending daily internet connectivity information to Giga Maps, helping Giga create an accurate picture of a school‚Äôs network quality over time. It was developed in partnership with Ericsson.

### [üß±Giga Blocks](https://github.com/unicef/giga-blocks)  
**Description:**  
GigaBlocks is the world‚Äôs largest decentralized database of schools.

The GigaBlocks project represents a transformative approach to harnessing the collective power of the global community to crowd-source data collection, validation and data updating for schools and in the process creating the largest decentralized school database using NFTs.

GigaBlocks aims to solve this problem by crowdsourcing the collection and curation of this missing data and creating a comprehensive database of school information, comparable to a Wikipedia page for each school. By enabling the community surrounding each school to curate and update the data on the NFTs, GigaBlocks hopes to gather accurate and up-to-date information on schools around the world. This will allow Giga to map the need for connectivity more granularly and will help Giga to more effectively connect schools to the internet and provide digital access to young people. Simultaneously, GigaBlocks will create a way for anyone to contribute data to schools, validate and update this data, and become a Giga Supporter.
